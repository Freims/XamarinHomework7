This is a simple app to test XAML tips and tricks. TeamHUB lets a team create and share events with team members. Admins can create,
see and delete events. Normal users can only see and delete events.

Some screenshots of the app:

Tips and tricks that I used:

1. Accessing static variables from the XAML for the app name.
2. Data trigger to change the text of a label according to a user's role.
3. Line breaks.
4. Generic styles for buttons and labels.
5. String formatting.
